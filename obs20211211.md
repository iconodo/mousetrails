Remarks to generation of files out2221046 to out2221069 by Cerebral Palsy user 

## I.- `ENVIRONMENT` 

   * `SYSTEM` SAMSUNG R540 - Intel(R) Core TM i3 CPU M 370 @ 2.40GHz x 4 3.7 GiB of RAM AMD(R) Rv710 Graphics

   * `OS` (virtual macOS-Simple-KVM ) macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS 64 bits Gnome version 3.36.8 Windowing System x11

   * `SCRIPTING` mniAudicle version 1.4.1.0 (gidora) git 916ee78 Copyright (c) Spencer Salazar. [Chuck](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu): version 1.4.1.0 (numchucks) 64-bit Copyright (c) Ge Wang and Perry Cook 
   
   * `JOYSTICK MOUSE` [OPM-200](https://www.tecnoaccesible.net/catalogo/rat%C3%B3n-de-joystick-opm-200). 

   * `ABOUT THE SUBJECT` In a relaxed mood. Wiiling to deliver about the "tests".

   * `THE PLACE` Conveniently set cyber access room. With a few interruptions by fellow Residence internet users. 

   * `PERSONAL POSITION AND STABILITY OF MOUSE` The subject was able to rest her left hand on her wheelchair (with which she moves the cursor and left clicks the mouse) specially in 15 seconds spans between cursor positioning and clicking. The mouse was firmly sticked to the table with velcro ribbons.

## II.- `CONTROLLED CHANGES OF CONDITIONS`

   * `The buttons Map. REMARKS.` A run of the Chuck's MiniAudicle script generates 8 buttons after the initial Yield button, at X==0, Y==0 of the script window. From file cont.txt, the script gets a number (1000, 1001, etc.) that, if EVEN, generates a fixed button map, due to a "random seed"; if ODD, generates a random map. REMARKS. Random (unseeded) scripts generate different buttons maps each running; while "random seeded" scripts generate same buttons map IF subject timely clicks once on every button. Missing one click results in an appropriaton of trail information to next button name. 

   * `The traces Map` Traces, and the initial trace (rows with label "Yield") are constituted by a cumulative sum of deltaX and deltaY magnitudes over variables XofTrace and YofTrace, respectively; with YofTrace adding the negative of the deltaY magnitude, since the MiniAudicle windowing system situates the origin of the window (x == 0, y == 0) at the upper left corner, and positive magnitudes in the Y axis are downwards for the MiniAudicle.

## III.- `SELECTED DATA FILES direct observations`


   * `From out2221046.txt to out2221060-- ` Subject had 15 seconds to reach and click each button
   
   - out2221046.txt: subject was asked to left click the mouse with her fingertip instead of closed finger joint. Some twists over last GO 8 button.
   - out2221048.txt: On button YIELD, two clicks. Some delay releasing FRAY 5 button. Clicking Timed out on last GO 8 button.
   - out2221049.txt: On last GO 8 button, two clicks.
   - out2221052.txt: From TIA 3 button, a fellow resident enters the room. Subject seems to get nervous. 
   - out2221054.txt: More people into the room! Subject was timing out on button YIELD and the controller made the click on the button.  Part of the excersise unattended by the controller. Missing clicks? Atypical even file map? From this file up to out2221058.txt (3 files), the  observer manually increments by 1 file cont.txt in order to produce even file maps. Subject acknowledges the similarity of the maps every third running.
   - out2221059.txt on: back to odd/even file maps.
   - out2221060.txt: unattended by observer.
                 
   * `From out2221061.txt to out2221063-- ` Subject had 10 seconds to reach and click each button

   - out2221061.txt: from start up to button TIA 3 included, unattended by observer. Rest of the take seemed Ok. despite the increase of the speed.
   - out22210662.txt: no click timed out on SAN 2, and FRAY 5 buttons.
   - out22210663.txt: no click timed out on FRAY 5 button.
   
   * `From out2221064.txt to out2221066-- ` Subject had 8 seconds to reach and click each button. Problems emerged from the time pressure (the announcement by the observer? and the time span itself):
   
   - out22210664.txt: two clicks on SAN 2 button, no click time out on GO 4 button.
   - out22210665.txt: two clicks on FRAY 1 button, no clicks time out on SAN 6, TIA 7 buttons.
    
   * `From out2221067.txt to out2221068-- ` Subject had 10 seconds to reach and click each button. She made them through without problems.
