    * RMI's credo's fragment in FAQ: 
    
_Would there be tradeoffs in performance or styling?_
`The fundamental thesis underlying the Hypercar® concept is that high fuel efficiency and low emissions
can be achieved without compromising the car's marketable features (such as performance) and without
imposing burdensome constraints on its body styling. RMI bases its fuel-efficiency modeling on a vehicle
that would perform equivalently to, or better than, a current five-to-six-passenger touring-class sedan, such
as the full-featured versions of the Ford Taurus, Chevrolet Lumina, or Chrysler Concorde.
While some changes would be required to improve aerodynamics, the body designer would still have
significant stylistic freedom.` in [Hypercar® Vehicles

### Yes!!... this is Heaven!!
We only have to adapt the 'total design' approach of RMI's hypercar, describe/outline our solutions, convince the Academia/Enterprises and sooner or later we'll be seeing one after the other the very best cost/efective `similar` solutions parading down our town streets :) ... or our assistive text entry technologies.
