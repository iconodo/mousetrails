II.1. `Heaven... I'm in heaven` - beyond "severe sight damaging"... and the `actual "cars not so sexy anymore" cause they all look like the "toys" depicted in` [Short History of RMI HyperCars](http://www.autoblog.com/2007/01/05/a-short-history-of-the-rmi-hypercar-ultralight-vehicle-concept/)

    * RMI's credo's fragment in FAQ: 
    
_Would there be tradeoffs in performance or styling?_
`The fundamental thesis underlying the Hypercar® concept is that high fuel efficiency and low emissions
can be achieved without compromising the car's marketable features (such as performance) and without
imposing burdensome constraints on its body styling. RMI bases its fuel-efficiency modeling on a vehicle
that would perform equivalently to, or better than, a current five-to-six-passenger touring-class sedan, such
as the full-featured versions of the Ford Taurus, Chevrolet Lumina, or Chrysler Concorde.
While some changes would be required to improve aerodynamics, the body designer would still have
significant stylistic freedom.` in [Hypercar® Vehicles

### Yes!!... this is Heaven!!
We only have to adapt the 'total design' approach of RMI's hypercar, describe/outline our solutions, convince the Academia/Enterprises and sooner or later we'll be seeing one after the other the very best cost/efective `similar` solutions parading down our town streets :) 

II.2. `Heaven down on Earth` - beyond  `We have a habit in writing articles published in scientific journals to make the work as finished as possible, to cover all the tracks, to not worry about the blind alleys or to describe how you had the wrong idea first, and so on. So there isn't any place to publish, in a dignified manner, what you actually did in order to get to do the work, although, there has been in these days, some interest in this kind of thing.` first phrases of [Richard Feynman's Nobel Lecture](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/feynman-lecture.html)

***If GitHub is the place to meet Feynman's idea, how many of this site  'commits' will meet our needs:

II.3 Click here to push ideas on [_Assistive Technology beyond severe spasticity_](https://github.com/iconodo/mice-nmen/blob/master/beyondSpasms.md) and/or click here to push ideas on [_FriedReich Ataxia_](https://github.com/iconodo/mice-nmen/blob/master/beyondFA.md). 

My intution tells me that solutions based in photonics, after/before achieving a `left mouse click interrupt` might also be able to send a transducible protein Frataxin synthesis message welcomed by mithocondrias...
