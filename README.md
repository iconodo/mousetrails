Joystick mouse trails in Cerebral Palsy User

### Stairs towards:

## `Inferencing of a spasms dictionary from...`

   * `Folder chuckedData text files -- ` 
[in this repository](https://github.com/iconodo/mousetrails/blob/master/chuckedData)
    
               AND CodePushing it INTO 
                  
   * `Dasher's sources -- ` 
[dasher: a keyboardless text entry software](https://github.com/dasher-project/dasher/releases) (...explore usage in the wiki section)

   * `my yet untouched Up2Date Dasher's fork -- ` 
[Dasher Version 5](https://github.com/iconodo/dasher) (while I have been able to build from zipped/cloned files from the above link in Ubuntu 18, 20 systems and Windows 10 systems, I have not touched nor cloned this fork yet)

    
     
## I.- `Generating and exploring the data...`


   * `... shown from min 3:40+ ` 
[in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7NFJpr7pNQ). The use of...

   * `Chuck digital music software script -- ` 
[trails.ck](https://github.com/iconodo/mousetrails/blob/master/trails.ck).  And...

   * `RStudio script -- ` 
[realTrails.R](https://github.com/iconodo/mousetrails/blob/master/realTrails.R). 

Note. In the above mentioned YouTube video, under the info (show more) section, there is a Google drive link loaded with redundant instructions on how to install and run the tools to generate and explore the mouse trails files. 
Warning. While most of scripting features in ChucK's MiniAudicle and R scripts features can be runned in macOSs, Windows and Linux_S OSs, the windowing system for the ChucK script above is only supported in MacOSs systems.


## II.- `Explaining the need...`


   * `... coping with spasticity while using Dasher -- ` given some sort of filter able to distinguishing and undoing the excesive "faulty" movements would help the efficiency of the text input and perhaps would better the neuromuscular relaxation as well. This latter perhaps also would influence the improvement of the writing.
   

## III.- `The wishlist...`


   * `... coding/pseudocoding a spasms dictionary -- ` Dasher includes text files in almost all languages on Earth that train the software each time you choose another one; thus, changing the actual dictionary used in the prediction of words/phrases. And, incrementally, builds on the user's wording preferences in a similar fashion to the mobiles keyboards suggestions.
      
   * `... coding it into Dasher's sources training engines -- ` Being able to include into the Dasher engines a similar-to-languages dictionary of "mouse forbidden movements" AND GETTING AROUND THEM would be the jewel of this up to this day far crown.
