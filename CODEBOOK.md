Joystick mouse trails in Cerebral Palsy User

     
## I.- `THE DATA FILES STRUCTURE` 


   * `... shown from min 3:40+ ` 
[in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7NFJpr7pNQ). The use of...

	** `Yet another level?....`

   * `Chuck digital music software script -- ` 
[trails.ck](https://github.com/iconodo/mousetrails/blob/master/trails.ck).  And...

   * `RStudio script -- ` 
[realTrails.R](https://github.com/iconodo/mousetrails/blob/master/realTrails.R). 

Note. In the above mentioned YouTube video, under the info (show more) section, there is a Google drive link loaded with redundant instructions on how to install and run the tools to generate and explore the mouse trails files.


## II.- `Explaining the need...`


   * `... coping with spasticity while using Dasher -- ` with a kind of filter able to distinguishing and undoing the excesive "faulty" movements would help the efficiency of the input of text and perhaps would better the neuromuscular relaxation as well, that would also result in the whole text capturing performance.
   

## III.- `The wishlist...`


   * `... coding/pseudocoding a spasms dictionary -- ` Dasher includes text files in many many languages that train the software each time you change from one language to another one; thus, changing the actual dictionary used in the prediction of words/phrases; and, incrementally, builds a user's repetition of phrases based dictionary.
      
   * `... coding it into Dasher's sources training engines -- ` Being able to include in the Dasher engines a similar dictionary of "mouse forbidden movements" and getting around them would be the jewel of this up to this day far crown.
